    <h1>Chicken Peri-Peri</h1>
    <img src="../images/chicken.jpeg" alt="">

    <p>Peri Peri Chicken is a flavorful meal of any cut of chicken that is marinated in and also served with a homemade peri peri sauce, a hot pepper sauce from south Africa. If you've never enjoyed south African Peri Peri Chicken, it's definitely a treat, especially with chicken legs. I love the leg part of the chicken. They're always tender and juicy, and they're pretty darned easy to cook.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>FOR THE PERI PERI CHICKEN</li>
        <li>6 chicken legs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>FOR THE PERI PERI MARINADE INGREDIENTS</li>
        <li>1 pound red chilies chopped African Birds Eye peppers are </li>traditional, but you can sub with red peppers available to you</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika you can sub in other chili powders</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped basil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Juice from 1 lemon</li>
        <li>Salt to taste (and black pepper, if desired)</li>
        <li>FOR SERVING: Chopped parsley, spicy chili flakes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For the peri peri sauce, add the peppers, garlic, paprika, cilantro and basil to a food processor. Process until well mixed.</li>
        <li>Drizzle in the olive oil while continuing to process until the mixture thickens up.</li>
        <li>Use half of the peri peri sauce to cover the chicken. Toss them together to get the chicken legs nicely coated.</li>
        <li>Bake the chicken for 35-40 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. They should measure 165 degrees F internally when measured with a meat thermometer. I like to use my ThermoPop meat thermometer from ThermoWorks (I'm an affiliate). Works great! Cooking time can vary, so be sure to check your temperatures.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with fresh herbs and spicy chili flakes. Serve! So good baked in the oven.</li>
    </ol>
